# 🍽️ Saren’s Calorie Tracker — Sandbox UI Prototype

## Overview

This website is a **finished front-end sandbox prototype** for a calorie and habit tracking app I’m currently designing and building. It’s not connected to a live backend or database yet, but it represents the **UI and feature direction** I plan to bring into the actual application.

The goal of this project is to simplify health tracking for people like me—those trying to build healthier habits without feeling overwhelmed or judged. Most calorie apps on the market feel cluttered, complex, or generic. This prototype is my way of starting from scratch, grounded in what actually matters to me.

## Why I’m Building This

I’ve been overweight for much of my life, and that’s taken a toll—not just physically, but emotionally and mentally too. After trying dozens of apps that didn’t stick, I decided to stop searching and start building. I wanted something that could help me:

- Log food and track macros without guilt
- Reflect on my day and feelings
- Keep things minimal and personal

This prototype was my way of taking control. It may not be perfect, but it’s mine—and it’s the first step toward a full-featured app I plan to develop.

## What This Prototype Includes

- ✅ A clean, responsive UI for logging food and exercise
- ✅ A calorie donut chart (powered by Chart.js)
- ✅ Macro tracking for carbs, protein, and fat
- ✅ Burned calorie estimation based on exercise duration
- ✅ Maintenance calorie input
- ✅ Personal reflection journal with editable entries

> **Note:** This version uses a local JavaScript object (no API) for demo purposes. It supports only a small list of preset foods and estimates exercise calories with a fixed formula.

### Foods You Can Log:
- Banana
- Apple
- Rice
- Chicken breast
- Salmon
- Egg
- Oatmeal
- Bread
- Yogurt
- Milk

### Exercises:
- You can input any activity name  
- Calories burned are estimated at ~8 kcal/minute

## Work in Progress: Full App Version

For the **main version of this app**, I’ve begun integrating the [Edamam Nutrition API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-nutrition-api) to support accurate calorie and macro data for thousands of foods. I plan to build the final version in **React Native** with a **Firebase** backend so users can:

- Create accounts and save daily logs
- Access accurate nutrition info from real databases
- Track weekly progress and reflections
- Get nudges and visual feedback over time

This sandbox is where I explore the interface and experience—before plugging in the real data, features, and backend logic.

To me, being a builder isn’t always about big or complex projects—it’s about making something that actually helps, even if it’s just helping yourself. This is my start.

Thanks for reading.
